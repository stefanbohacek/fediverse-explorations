- your work needs to be **freely accessible** (no paywall, no sign-ups required)
- while not required, **sharing your dataset and/or any code** you used to collect, analyze, and visualize the data is highly encouraged
- no funny business (If you're wondering whether you're doing funny business, you probably are.)
